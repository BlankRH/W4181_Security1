environment: the test archive should be created/operated inside hw1_store


run:

make: this will create the executable cstore in the hw1_store directory

make test: this will run the test script; it could be done by hand via ./script.sh

make clean: this will clean the test files generated by my test script


example:

.\cstore init [-p password] archive1 archive2 ...
.\cstore list archive
.\cstore add [-p password] archive file1 file2 ...
.\cstore extract [-p password] archive file1 file2 ...
.\cstore delete [-p password] archive file1 file2 ...


command descriptions:

.\cstore init [-p password] archive1 archive2 ...

init should create multiple archives with same password. If the archive to be created already exists, the program will print an error to STDERR

additional function description:
init is the only option that supports operating multiple archive at a time; the archives created in the sameline has the same password
metadata.txt and hashcode.txt are plaintext files
metadata.txt contains filenames in the archive
hashcode contains the HMAC code

algorithm description:
I implemented AES-CBC in my_aes.
